# Codher Purely Functional Interfaces in Elm

## Agenda

## Introduction

Welcome to Codher's Elm Workshop!

Let's challenge the status quo of Functional Programming in the world of User Interfaces! We are going to build an interactive experience in a purely functional language with the help of one of the most user-friendly compilers.

Happy coding, have fun!

## Recommended Software

You can use whichever code editor you prefer.

We are going to use [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) to create and run the application.
