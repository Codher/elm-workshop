# Codher Purely Functional Interfaces in Elm

## Agenda

- Getting started with Elm and Create Elm App
- Intro into Functional Programming
- Rendering HTML and CSS
- Building interactive applications

## Introduction

Welcome to Codher's Elm Workshop!

Let's challenge the status quo of Functional Programming in the world of User Interfaces! We are going to build an interactive experience in a purely functional language with the help of one of the most user-friendly compilers.

Happy coding, have fun!

## Recommended Software

You can use whichever code editor you prefer.

We are going to use [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) to set up and run the application.
