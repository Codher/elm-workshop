# Codher Purely Functional Interfaces in Elm

## Introduction

Welcome to Codher's Elm Workshop!

Functional Programming is fun and easy if you learn by doing.

Have you ever tried programming in a language, where the compiler is your best friend? Imagine an app without errors at run-time.

Sounds promising?

Immutable data types and structures make it easier to reason about how data changes in your program.

Purity allows you to create deterministic and predictable functionality.

Reactive nature of the Elm Architecture enables a straight-forward data-flow.

Elm is Immutable, Pure and Reactive by nature and all of that is available to you now!

Get an introduction to Elm Compiler and Time-Travelling Debugger and start coding!

Level: Basic understanding of JavaScript

Happy coding, have fun!

## Agenda

- Getting started with Elm and Create Elm App
- Intro into Functional Programming
- Rendering HTML and CSS
- Building interactive applications

## Recommended Software

You can use whichever code editor you prefer.

We are going to use [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app) to set up and run the application.
